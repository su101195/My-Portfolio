## Projects
**Conceptual Design of a Sustainable SmallSat Constellation to Enable Reliable Lunar Communication Network**

[Publication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/364310234_Conceptual_Design_of_a_Sustainable_SmallSat_Constellation_to_Enable_Reliable_Lunar_Communication_Network)

The present work tackles the conceptual design and the architecture of a sustainable OCT constellation of SmallSats in a frozen orbit around the Moon to enable a reliable communication network and to contribute to create the building blocks for future space exploration infrastructure.

**Conceptual Design of a Mars Constellation for Global Communication Services using Small Satellites** [January 2020 - October 2020]

[Publication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344689642_Conceptual_Design_of_a_Mars_Constellation_for_Global_Communication_Services_using_Small_Satellites)

The project objective was to design a Small Satellite Constellation around Mars to provide communication services for future users (rovers, astronauts) on the surface of Mars. 
My contribution was to design a 8 satellite constellation that provides 100% coverage over the entire surface of Mars using STK.
Additionally, I was involved in designing a highly perturbed Earth-Mars transfer using MATLAB and NASA’s GMAT software. 

**Optimization of Interplanetary Trajectory using Fmincon** [November 2019 - April 2020]

Computed the transfer trajectory parameters for Earth-Uranus with flybys about Jupiter and Saturn using the Patched Conics Method
along with the Fmincon optimization algorithm.
Reduced the thrust value ∆v by 20% using Fmincon as compared to the value obtained using the conventional Patched Conics Method in MATLAB. 

**Passive Magnetic Attitude Control Design for HERON MK2 satellite** [November 2018 - October 2019]

Was involved in Magnet design and performing simulations to ensure the proposed design parameters of the Magnets and Rods achieved the required objective.
