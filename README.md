## Projects

**Conceptual Design of a Mars Constellation for Global Communication Services using Small Satellites** [January 2020 - October 2020]
- The project objective was to design a Small Satellite Constellation around Mars to provide communication services for future users (rovers, astronauts) on the surface of Mars. 
- Designed a 8 satellite constellation that provides 100% coverage over the entire surface of Mars using STK.
- Designed a highly perturbed Earth-Mars transfer using MATLAB and NASA’s GMAT software. 

**Optimization of Interplanetary Trajectory using Fmincon** [November 2019 - April 2020]
- Computed the transfer trajectory parameters for Earth-Uranus with flybys about Jupiter and Saturn using the Patched Conics Method
along with the Fmincon optimization algorithm.
- Reduced the thrust value ∆v by 20% using Fmincon as compared to the value obtained using the conventional Patched Conics Method in MATLAB. 

**Passive Magnetic Attitude Control Design for HERON MK2 satellite** [November 2018 - October 2019]
- Was involved in Magnet design and performing simulations to ensure the proposed design parameters of the Magnets and Rods achieved the required objective.
